# Rbduk

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of Rbduk is to provide BDUK analysts with a centralised set of repeatable functions for BDUK-specific R work.

## Installation

You can install the released version of Rbduk from [sam.atkin@dcms.gov.uk](sam.atkin@dcms.gov.uk) with:

``` r
devtools::install.github("NAME/Rbduk")
```

## is_integer64()

Within GCP, large numbers (eg UPRNs) are stored are 64-bit integers. R, on the whole, does not like 64-bit integer, and whilst it can cope, it's easier to read in these columns are numeric, or convert them to numeric within R. To see if an object is currently a 64-bit integer, this function can be used.

```{r is_integer64}
library(Rbduk)

is_integer64(100)

is_integer64("x")

```

## pretty_postcode()

This function takes a postcode in any format and any case, and converts it into pretty format XX(X)(X)(Y)XXX, where X is the postcode, and Y is the specified seperator, which is a space by default. The case can also be specified, and is upper case by default.

```{r pretty_postcode}
library(Rbduk)

pretty_postcode("SW1a2nP")

pretty_postcode("SW1a2nP", sep="")

pretty_postcode("SW1a2nP", sep=".")

pretty_postcode("SW1a2nP", sep=".", uppercase=FALSE)

```

## is_postcode()

This function takes a string and returns TRUE or FALSE depedent on whether the string is in a valid UK postcode format or not. This may contain one space and still be valid. This does not indicate whether a postcode is an existing postcode, but that is has the format of one.

```{r is_postcode}
library(Rbduk)

is_postcode("SW1a2nP")

is_postcode("SW1a 2nP")

is_postcode("S 2NP")

is_postcode("Sw1a.2np")

is_postcode("Sw1a2npX")

is_postcode("Sw1a  2np")

is_postcode("000000")

is_postcode("XXXXXX")

```
